# Bromesh: BSON-Replicated Object Mesh

## Design Intent

Bromesh intends to provide an asynchronous network protocol for decentralized object transaction,
with performant [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/)-inspired transport encapsulation,
multi-domain/tenant/application semantics, and natively-specified constructs
for composing a variety of [Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://eaipatterns.com/).
